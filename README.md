# android-room-architecture

This use case was developed following the instructions given on the youtube channel named "Coding in Flow". It's a 10 videos playlist named "Android Architecture Components Beginner Tutorial - Room + ViewModel + LiveData + RecyclerView (MVVM)".

"In this playlist you will learn how to use the Android Architecture Components Room, ViewModel, LiveData and Lifecycle.
For this we will build a simple note-taking app that stores data in an SQLite database and displays it in a RecyclerView. The app architecture will follow a Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern.
I will start by explaining what the Android Architecture Components are and why we should use them, and throughout the series I will then explain each component in more detail."
